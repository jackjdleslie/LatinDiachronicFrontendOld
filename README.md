The Latin Diachronic Database is a project of Digital Humanities invented by Tommaso Spinelli (Ph.D. candidate, Classics, St. Andrews University) and co-developed with Giacomo Fenzi (Computer Science and Mathematics student, St. Andrews University). This project aims to create an innovative toolkit for the quantitative computational analysis of the Latin language as well as to support and further enhance the digital study of ancient intertextuality.

For more information on the toolkit view the [original repository](https://github.com/WizardOfMenlo/LatinDiachronicDatabase).
